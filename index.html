<h1>Gravity</h1>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician and mathematician and physicist who lived from 1642-1727. Newton formulated the 'Newtons Law'; he stated that in in the first law, an object will not change its motion unless a force acts on it. In the second law, the force on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration. In the third law, when two objects interact, they apply forces to each other of equal magnitude and opposite direction. The legend is that Newton discovered Gravity when he saw a falling apple while thinking about the forces of nature, but many believe this never happend </p>
<p>There was no such thing as gravity before its discovery. If you jumped, you would never be found again. </p>
