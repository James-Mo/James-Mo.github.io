<h1>Gravity</h1>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician and mathematician and physicist who lived from 1642-1727. The legend is that Newton discovered Gravity when he saw a falling apple while thinking about the forces of nature. </p>
<p>There was no such thing as gravity before its discovery. If you jumped, you would never be found again. </p>
